Hello! I am from Seattle, Washington. I got my undergraduate degree from Colorado State University, and am beginning graduate school at the University of Washington this fall. 

I am very interested in all things data science, statistics, and computer science. I have a special interest in using my technical skills for research, public health, and sports.

My experience is mostly research based. During my undergrad at CSU, I engaged in two research projects. First, with the Department of Statistics, I tested complex methods to limit confounding in spatial data, specifically Thin Plate Regression Splines. Next, with the College of Engineering, I worked in the fascinating field of image de-noising, where I researched and developed deep learning solutions to enhance image quality for a biomedical imaging lab. Most recently I took more of an analyst role, again with the CSU Statistics department. I worked with spatial air pollution data, where I conducted analyses, wrangled data, created visualizations, and presented findings. I also was a Calculus 1 Tutor and TA for two years at the CSU Calculus Center.
