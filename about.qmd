Hello! I am from Seattle, Washington. I got my undergraduate degree from Colorado State University, and am currently a graduate student at the University of Washington. 

I am very interested in all things data science, computer science, and statistics. I have a special interest in using my technical skills for research, public health and sports.

My experience is mostly research based. During my undergrad at Colorado State University, I engaged in two research projects. First, with the Department of Statistics, I focused on testing complex methods to limit confounding in spatial data, specifically Thin Plate Regression Splines. Next, with the College of Engineering, I worked in the fascinating field of image de-noising, where I researched and developed deep learning solutions to enhance image quality. Most recently I worked in more of an analyst role, again with the CSU Statistics department. I worked with spatial air pollution data, where I conducted analyses, wrangled data, created visualizations, and presented findings.
