Dr. Pablo Pinedo and Dr. Manriquez Alvarez of the CSU Department of Animal Sciences have a lot of data on cow pregnancies - health scores, milk produced, previous pregnancies, etc. They want to be able to predict the probability of a cow losing their pregnancy. Being able to accurately predict this would be extremely helpful for farmers everywhere and would be a huge step in precision farming. Below is a paper outlining the project. Further work to be done is to create an app for ease of use.
